# To-Do App

A simple and responsive To-Do list application built using **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The app allows users to add, update, and delete tasks, with a clean UI.

ðŸš¨ **Important**: Since the app is deployed on Render, the server may take up to 1 minute to wake up if idle, so please allow some time for the site to load initially.

## Live Demo

## Technologies Used
### Frontend
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive CSS design.
- **Vite**: Development tool for building React apps.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server-side application.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js to build the API.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing the tasks.

## Challenges Faced
1. **Server Idle Time**: One challenge faced was dealing with Render's waiting time. The server goes idle when unused for a while and can take up to 1 minute to wake up. To handle this, a loading indicator was implemented on the frontend, and users are informed about the delay.
